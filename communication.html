			<h3>Contemporary Uses</h3>
		
			<ul class="list-group">
				<li class="list-group-item">Social Media (e.g. <a href="https://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>) — They allow others to communicate, socially, in ways not yet seen before. They also allow people to reconnect, and to make friends they never would have.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Video Conferencing (e.g. Zoom) — As the aeroplane connected the world before, video conferencing has linked the world. Instantaneous and clear communication can be established accross continents, and the globe.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Online Purchases (e.g. Amazon, eBay) — Companies such as Amazon have made it possible to purchase something and have it arrive the next day, from the comfort of one's own home.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Finance (Banking, Securities Trading, Cryptographic Currencies) — Anyone can start trading, but for the already experienced traders, computer systems are allowing them to trade even quicker, making the stock market floor all but dead. Not to mention the number of computer systems taking traders' jobs entirely.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Gaming — Online Gaming can connect friends from streets away, or continents away, giving people the chance to play against the very best without ever meeting them. Furthermore, the opportunity to download games has now been developed, such that players can download the latest game without having to ever hold a physical copy.</li>

				<li class="list-group-item">EMail — Electronic Mail was first introduced in the 1960s, but by 2004 GMail had entered the market, the most successful website email client. It made email easier than ever to use.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Weather — Useful and mundane information, such as the weather, can be checked in seconds with the power of the web. With the advent of newer technologies it is also more accurate than ever.</li>
